Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

So that I don't accidentally lose changes on a branch - if it's shared between users. Or even if working on the code from multiple computers.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

A fork gives appropriate credit to the original developer(s) and is, ideally, fully functional.
A clone is a complete copy of a repository, but it lacks obvious trackability back to the original creator, though that could be in a README or other documents.
A branch is a complete copy of the repository - at a certain point in time. It can be merged into another branch in the same repository. In all likelihood it contains commits that original branch did not - that is its purpose.
