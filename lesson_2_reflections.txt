How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

It's a subset of all the files and directories - allowing greater control and preventing needless file bloat.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

By typically updating only one file at a time, the scope of the change and the comments can be limited to one logical change. 
It also forces the process to be delibereate.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?

Testing new features - alpha, beta testing, researching bugs, 
creating a copy of the code so I can play with the code without fear - learning language(s) as I do so.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

They outline the sequence of events logically and you can easily read where code separated from the main logic.
This is much clearer than the details in git log.

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in the diagram the way we do?

What are the pros and cons of Gitâ€™s automatic merging vs. always doing merges manually?

With the safeguards it has in place, automatic is far preferrable and much less likely to result in overlooked changes.
