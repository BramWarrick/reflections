How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

It's a subset of all the files and directories - allowing greater control and preventing needless file bloat.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

By typically updating only one file at a time, the scope of the change and the comments can be limited to one logical change. 
It also forces the process to be delibereate.
