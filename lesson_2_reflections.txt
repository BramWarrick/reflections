How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

It's a subset of all the files and directories - allowing greater control and preventing needless file bloat.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

By typically updating only one file at a time, the scope of the change and the comments can be limited to one logical change. 
It also forces the process to be delibereate.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?

Testing new features - alpha, beta testing, researching bugs, 
creating a copy of the code so I can play with the code without fear - learning language(s) as I do so.
